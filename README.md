VisionGuard-AI: Object Detection and Classification Project
===========================================================

Project Overview:
-----------------
VisionGuard-AI is an AI-powered object detection system built using YOLOv8. 
It detects multiple objects in images or video streams, classifies them, 
draws bounding boxes (localization), and provides confidence scores for each detected object.

Key Features:
-------------
1. Object Detection: Detect multiple objects in images.
2. Classification: Identify objects like persons, cars, cups, etc.
3. Localization: Draw bounding boxes around detected objects.
4. Confidence Score: Show the detection confidence for each object.
5. Real-time Detection (optional): Can be extended to webcam or video streams.
6. Results Visualization: Bounding boxes and labels over images.
